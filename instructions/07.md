Auto-Joins with Doctrine
------------------------

The doctrine visitor supports the detections of joins in your rules.

### 1. Create a in heard spec
 
Create a `InHerd` specification which searches for a given herd name
as join on the `Unicorn` entity.

The specification should use the `getParameters` and get the name from
the constructor!

### 2. Execute and verify!
