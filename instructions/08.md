Use custom functions
--------------------

RulerZ supports custom functions in the rules, lets use that simply birth date
queries.

### 1. Create a Baby spec

Create a baby spec with an `age(2)` comparison to the birth date.

### 2. Use a array data source

For testing we use first an array of unicorns again.

```php
$babyUnicorn = new Unicorn('Elsie');
$babyUnicorn->setBirthDate(new \DateTime('-1 year'));

$teenageUnicorn = new Unicorn('Ryan');
$teenageUnicorn->setBirthDate(new \DateTime('-16 year'));

$unicorns = [$babyUnicorn, $teenageUnicorn];
```

### 3. Create the age operator

If you already tried to test it, you can see we are missing the age operator.
Lets create one. Create a `ArrayAgeOperator` class in
`src/AppBundle/Spec/Operator` with a `__invoke` method which should return
the `\DateTime` equivalent of the given age.

Hint: Look above!

### 4. Add it to the array visitor

Now you can register it on the array visitor at the RulerZ instantiation:

```php
new Target\ArrayVisitor([
    'age' => new ArrayAgeOperator(),
]),
```

### 5. Verify result!
